[USER]: what is anti dumping?

[ASSISTANT]: Anti-dumping refers to trade measures that countries use to protect their domestic industries from foreign companies selling products at below fair market value. It aims to prevent unfair competition and maintain fair trade practices. If you have more specific questions about it, feel free to ask!
